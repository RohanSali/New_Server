## üåü Overview

The Client Management System provides comprehensive tracking and management of all drones and applications connecting to your server. It offers both command-line tools and REST API endpoints for complete control over client access and monitoring.

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Registration**: New clients auto-register when they connect
- ‚úÖ **Authorization Control**: Approve/deny client access for security
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor online/offline status and connection history
- ‚úÖ **Persistent Storage**: Client data stored in `client_registry.json`
- ‚úÖ **Import/Export**: Backup and restore client configurations
- ‚úÖ **CLI & API**: Command-line tools and REST API endpoints

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Import Sample Clients (Recommended for Testing)
```bash
# Import 8 pre-configured clients (4 drones + 4 applications)
python manage_clients.py import sample_clients.json

# Verify import was successful
python manage_clients.py list
```

### 2. Check System Status
```bash
# View registry statistics
python manage_clients.py stats

# List all registered clients
python manage_clients.py list
```

### 3. Test Connection
Your clients should now be able to connect. Try connecting with any of these pre-configured IDs:
- **Drones**: `drone_001`, `drone_002`, `drone_003`, `drone_emergency_001`
- **Applications**: `app_security_center`, `app_ai_analyzer`, `app_mobile_dashboard`, `app_data_logger`

## üë• Client Registration

### Adding New Clients Manually

#### Basic Client Addition
```bash
# Add a drone
python manage_clients.py add my_drone_001 drone

# Add an application
python manage_clients.py add my_app_001 application
```

#### Advanced Client Addition with Details
```bash
# Add drone with full details
python manage_clients.py add patrol_drone_alpha drone \
  --name "Patrol Drone Alpha" \
  --description "Primary security patrol drone" \
  --capabilities alerts imaging navigation night_vision \
  --location '{"lat": 40.7128, "lng": -74.0060, "altitude": 100}'

# Add application with details
python manage_clients.py add monitoring_app application \
  --name "Security Monitoring App" \
  --description "Real-time security monitoring dashboard" \
  --capabilities monitoring analysis response incident_management
```

### Automatic Registration
When a client connects via WebSocket, it's automatically registered if not already present:
```
Client connects ‚Üí Auto-registration ‚Üí Authorization check ‚Üí Connection established
```

### Removing Clients
```bash
# Remove a specific client completely
python manage_clients.py remove my_drone_001

# This permanently deletes the client from registry
```

---

## üîê Authorization Management

### Understanding Authorization
- **New clients** are **authorized by default** for easy development
- **Deauthorized clients** cannot connect to the server
- Authorization can be changed at any time

### Authorization Commands

#### Authorize a Client
```bash
# Authorize a client (allow connections)
python manage_clients.py authorize drone_001

# Verify authorization status
python manage_clients.py show drone_001
```

#### Deauthorize a Client
```bash
# Deauthorize a client (block connections)
python manage_clients.py authorize drone_001 --deny

# Client will be disconnected and cannot reconnect
```

#### Check Authorization Status
```bash
# View client details including authorization
python manage_clients.py show drone_001

# List all clients with authorization status
python manage_clients.py list
```

### Authorization Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Block a Problematic Client
```bash
# Identify problematic client
python manage_clients.py show suspicious_drone

# Deauthorize immediately
python manage_clients.py authorize suspicious_drone --deny

# Client will be disconnected and blocked
```

#### Scenario 2: Temporary Access Control
```bash
# Deauthorize for maintenance
python manage_clients.py authorize maintenance_drone --deny

# Re-authorize when ready
python manage_clients.py authorize maintenance_drone
```

## üìä Client Information & Monitoring

### Viewing Client Information

#### List All Clients
```bash
# Basic list
python manage_clients.py list

# Example output:
# Client ID     | Type | Name           | Status | Connections | Last Connected | Authorized
# drone_001     | Drone| Patrol Alpha   | Online | 5           | 2025-01-01     | ‚úì
# app_monitor   | App  | Monitor App    | Offline| 12          | 2025-01-01     | ‚úì
```

#### Filter Client Lists
```bash
# List only drones
python manage_clients.py list --type drone

# List only applications
python manage_clients.py list --type application

# List only online clients
python manage_clients.py list --status online

# List only offline clients
python manage_clients.py list --status offline
```

#### Detailed Client Information
```bash
# View complete details for a specific client
python manage_clients.py show drone_001

# Example output:
# === Client Details: drone_001 ===
# Type: Drone
# Name: Surveillance Drone Alpha
# Status: Online
# Authorized: Yes
# Total Connections: 15
# Capabilities: alerts, imaging, navigation
# Location: {'lat': 40.7128, 'lng': -74.0060}
# Metadata: {...}
```

### Registry Statistics
```bash
# View system-wide statistics
python manage_clients.py stats

# Example output:
# === Registry Statistics ===
# Total Clients: 10
#   Drones: 6
#   Applications: 4
#   Authorized: 10
# 
# Currently Online: 3
#   Drones: 2
#   Applications: 1
```

### Monitoring Connection Activity

#### Real-time Connection Monitoring
- **Online Status**: Updated when clients connect/disconnect
- **Connection Count**: Tracks total lifetime connections per client
- **Last Connected**: Records timestamp of last connection
- **First Connected**: Records when client first connected

#### Connection History
```bash
# View client's connection history
python manage_clients.py show drone_001

# Check which clients are currently online
python manage_clients.py list --status online
```

## üíæ Import/Export Operations

### Exporting Client Data

#### Basic Export
```bash
# Export all clients to timestamped file
python manage_clients.py export

# Output: clients_export_20250101_103045.json
```

#### Custom Export Location
```bash
# Export to specific file
python manage_clients.py export --file my_client_backup.json
```

### Importing Client Data

#### Import from File
```bash
# Import clients from exported file
python manage_clients.py import my_client_backup.json

# Import sample configuration
python manage_clients.py import sample_clients.json
```

### Backup Strategies

#### Regular Backup
```bash
# Create daily backup
python manage_clients.py export --file "backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).json"
```

#### Pre-deployment Backup
```bash

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Client Cannot Connect
```
ERROR: Unauthorized connection attempt: my_drone
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check if client exists and is authorized
python manage_clients.py show my_drone

# If not found, add the client
python manage_clients.py add my_drone drone --name "My Drone"

# If found but not authorized, authorize it
python manage_clients.py authorize my_drone
```

#### Issue: Registry File Corruption
```
ERROR: Error loading client registry: Invalid JSON
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Restore from automatic backup
cp client_registry.json.backup client_registry.json

# Or import from export file
python manage_clients.py import my_backup.json

# Or start fresh with samples
python manage_clients.py import sample_clients.json
```

#### Issue: Client Shows as Offline but Should be Online
**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check client status
python manage_clients.py show problematic_client

# Check registry stats
python manage_clients.py stats
```

**Solutions:**
- Client may have disconnected unexpectedly
- Check server logs for connection errors
- Client will auto-update to online when it reconnects

#### Issue: Too Many Unauthorized Connections
**Solutions:**
```bash
# List all unauthorized clients
python manage_clients.py list | grep "‚úó"

# Bulk authorize if legitimate
python manage_clients.py authorize client_1
python manage_clients.py authorize client_2

# Or remove if not legitimate
python manage_clients.py remove suspicious_client
```

### Debugging Commands

#### Verify Registry Integrity
```bash
# Check registry stats
python manage_clients.py stats

# List all clients to verify data
python manage_clients.py list

# Check specific client details
python manage_clients.py show suspicious_client
```

#### Monitor Connection Issues
```bash
# Watch server logs while client connects
tail -f server.log

# Check API endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/api/clients/online

# Test client authorization
curl http://localhost:8000/api/clients/test_client
```

## ‚ú® Best Practices

### Development Environment

#### Quick Setup for Testing
```bash
# Import sample clients for immediate testing
python manage_clients.py import sample_clients.json

# Your test clients can connect immediately:
# - drone_001, drone_002, drone_003
# - app_security_center, app_ai_analyzer
```

#### Custom Test Clients
```bash
# Add your specific test clients
python manage_clients.py add test_drone_dev drone --name "Development Test Drone"
python manage_clients.py add test_app_dev application --name "Development Test App"
```

### Production Environment

#### Pre-register Production Clients
```bash
# Add production clients before deployment
python manage_clients.py add prod_drone_01 drone \
  --name "Production Drone 01" \
  --description "Primary production surveillance drone" \
  --capabilities alerts imaging navigation emergency_response

# Export configuration for deployment
python manage_clients.py export --file production_clients.json
```

#### Security Practices
```bash
# Regular audit of authorized clients
python manage_clients.py list | grep "‚úì" | wc -l

# Remove decommissioned clients
python manage_clients.py remove old_drone_001

# Regular backups
python manage_clients.py export --file "backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).json"
```

### Monitoring & Maintenance

#### Regular Health Checks
```bash
# Daily status check
python manage_clients.py stats

# Weekly client audit
python manage_clients.py list --status offline | grep "Never"  # Never connected clients

# Monthly backup
python manage_clients.py export --file "monthly_backup_$(date +%Y%m).json"
```

#### Performance Optimization
- **Remove unused clients** that never connect
- **Export/import** for database cleanup if registry grows large  
- **Monitor connection patterns** for unusual activity

### Integration Patterns

#### Automated Client Management
```bash
# Script to auto-add clients from config file
while IFS= read -r client_id; do
  python manage_clients.py add "$client_id" drone --name "Auto Added Drone $client_id"
done < drone_list.txt
```

#### API Integration
```python
import requests

# Python script to manage clients via API
def authorize_client(client_id, authorized=True):
    response = requests.put(
        f"http://localhost:8000/api/clients/{client_id}/authorize",
        params={"authorized": authorized}
    )
    return response.json()

# Usage
authorize_client("new_drone_001", True)
```
