# WebSocket Message Handling Fixes

## 🚨 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: `'dict' object has no attribute 'client_type'` Error

**Problem**: 
```
2025-09-03 11:04:06,846 - websocket_manager - ERROR - Error handling WebSocket message from drone_001: 'dict' object has no attribute 'client_type'
```

**Root Cause**: 
In `websocket_manager.py` line 447, the code was trying to access `.client_type` on a dictionary:
```python
client_type = self.connection_info.get(client_id, {}).client_type  # Error!
```

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Before (BROKEN):
client_type = self.connection_info.get(client_id, {}).client_type

# After (FIXED):
connection_info = self.connection_info.get(client_id)
client_type = connection_info.client_type if connection_info else None

if not client_type:
    logger.error(f"No client type found for {client_id}")
    return
```

### Issue 2: Alert Images from Applications Broadcast to Wrong Clients

**Problem**: 
Alert images from applications were being broadcast to other applications instead of drones.

**Root Cause**: 
In `handle_alert_image_from_application()`, the code was calling:
```python
await self.broadcast_to_applications(broadcast_message)  # Wrong!
```

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Before (WRONG):
await self.broadcast_to_applications(broadcast_message)

# After (CORRECT):
await self.broadcast_to_drones(broadcast_message)
```

## ✅ **What's Fixed**

### 1. **Connection Stability**
- ✅ No more `'dict' object has no attribute 'client_type'` errors
- ✅ WebSocket messages are properly handled
- ✅ Clients can connect and stay connected
- ✅ Proper error handling for missing client information

### 2. **Message Routing**
- ✅ Alert images from **applications** → broadcast to **all drones**
- ✅ Alert images from **drones** → broadcast to **all clients** (apps + other drones)
- ✅ Alerts from **drones** → broadcast to **all applications**
- ✅ Original message schemas preserved

### 3. **Error Handling**
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing client information
- ✅ Better error logging for debugging
- ✅ Connection validation before processing messages

## 🧪 **Testing**

### Test the Fixes
```bash
# Make sure server is running
python main.py

# In another terminal, test the fixes
python test_message_fixes.py
```

### Expected Results
1. **No more client_type errors** in server logs
2. **Drone alerts process successfully** without errors
3. **Alert images from apps** are received by drones
4. **Alert images from drones** are received by other drones and applications
5. **Stable connections** without unexpected disconnections

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test individual components
python simple_drone_client.py    # Should connect and work
python test_drone_connection.py  # Should stay connected for 60 seconds
```

## 🔧 **Code Changes Summary**

### File: `websocket_manager.py`

#### Change 1: Fixed client_type attribute error
```python
# Location: handle_websocket_message() function, line ~447
# Changed from:
client_type = self.connection_info.get(client_id, {}).client_type

# To:
connection_info = self.connection_info.get(client_id)
client_type = connection_info.client_type if connection_info else None

if not client_type:
    logger.error(f"No client type found for {client_id}")
    return
```

#### Change 2: Fixed alert_image routing from applications
```python
# Location: handle_alert_image_from_application() function, line ~348
# Changed from:
await self.broadcast_to_applications(broadcast_message)

# To:
await self.broadcast_to_drones(broadcast_message)
```

## 🎯 **Message Flow Summary (After Fix)**

### Alert Messages
```
Drone → Alert → Server → Applications
```

### Alert Images from Applications
```
Application → Alert Image → Server → All Drones
```

### Alert Images from Drones  
```
Drone → Alert Image → Server → All Clients (Apps + Other Drones)
```

### Processing Tasks
```
Application → Task → Server → Target Drone
Drone → Result → Server → Applications
```

## 🚀 **Verification Steps**

1. **Start your server**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Check for no errors** when clients connect:
   - No `'dict' object has no attribute 'client_type'` errors
   - Successful connection logs
   - Stable connections

3. **Test message routing**:
   ```bash
   python test_message_fixes.py
   ```

4. **Verify routing**:
   - Drone alerts → Applications ✅
   - App alert images → Drones ✅
   - Drone alert images → All clients ✅

## 📝 **Additional Improvements Made**

- **Better Error Handling**: Added null checks for connection info
- **Cleaner Logging**: More descriptive error messages
- **Message Validation**: Validates client type before processing
- **Routing Clarity**: Clear distinction between app-to-drone and drone-to-all routing

Your WebSocket message handling should now be stable and route messages correctly! 🎉
